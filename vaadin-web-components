# The Art of Reusable UIs: How to Paint by the Numbers with Vaadin Web Components

Ever wondered how to build user interfaces that not only look good but are also modular 
and easily integrated into different technology stacks? This talk will walk you through
a practical approach to UI development using the open-source Java-based Vaadin Web Components.

You'll learn how these components can be seamlessly used with Java frameworks Flow and
Hilla as well as popular JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and Vue.js, 
thanks to their framework-agnostic nature. The session will 
guide you through hands-on coding examples, showing you how to incorporate Vaadin components 
into your projects to enhance UI consistency and maintainability across multiple platforms.

We'll also dive into the open-source community contributions that make Vaadin's tools 
robust and versatile for building complex UIs. You'll walk away with a thorough understanding of 
how to utilize these open-source components to standardize and accelerate your UI development, 
making your applications not only functional but visually compelling.
