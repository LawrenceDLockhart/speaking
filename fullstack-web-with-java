# Fullstack from the back: A Java-driven approach to building web applications

It's traditional to think of building a web app beginning with front end technologies such at HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The Vaadin platform
flips that idea on it's head and offers solutions built around Java, a backend language.

In this session featuring live-coded examples, we'll dive into how Vaadin's web frameworks, Flow and Hilla, can help developers build complex web apps. 
We'll explore how these frameworks put the power in java developer's hands by either building web apps purely in Java, or
in a format utilizing Spring Boot and React in a single project. We'll show how to leverage Vaadin's web components as the core elements to build UIs that are 
both functional out of the box and customizable.
